Exercise 3:ðŸ’»

1 - Compile the Code:
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where your DirectoryLister3.java file is located.
Compile the code using the following command:

javac DirectoryLister3.java

This will generate a DirectoryLister3.class file.

2 - Run the Program:
After successful compilation, run the program by providing a valid directory path as an argument. For example:

java DirectoryLister3 /path/to/your/directory

Replace /path/to/your/directory with the actual path of the directory you want to list.

3 - Output:
The program will recursively list the contents of the specified directory and its subdirectories.
It will create an output_ex3.txt file in the current directory and save the directory listing in the specified format.
-> The listDirectoryContents method recursively lists files and directories, sorting them alphabetically.
For each file, it prints the type (D for directory, F for file), name, and last modified timestamp.
